# IPL-First-Innings-Score-Prediction Using Linear Regression Algorithm

# Introduction

Cricket is one of the most popular outdoor sports that has captured everyone’s heart. There are many series that are held, and the Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of them which has a long and illustrious tradition in the sports world. IPL is a professional Twenty20 (T20) league started in 2008 which was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The IPL is a 20-over league, which means each team plays 20 overs from both sides. Every year, eight teams from eight Indian cities participate in this league. A cricket match is influenced by a variety of factors, and the factors that have a major impact on the outcome of a T20 cricket match are described in this project. This project takes several years of IPL data, including player information, match location information, team information, and ball to ball information, and analyzes it to draw different conclusions that help in the enhancement of player’s results. It focuses on calculating the results of IPL matches using data mining techniques on both balanced and imbalanced datasets. In T20 Cricket matches, the first innings score is currently estimated based on the existing run rate, which is measured as the number of runs scored per a number of overs bowled. It includes the following factors:

Number of wickets left
Number of balls left
On how much scores are the current batsman batting?
How much has the team scored in the last 5 years?
How much did the team have lost wickets in the last 5 overs?
The nature of the pitch
How strong is the batting and bowling team?
Steps Involved
Firstly, the data is trained. We will take 15-20% of the data from the data collection to train the model.
We will take 15-20% of the data from the data collection to train the model.
For the prediction, we will be using a Linear regression algorithm.
The project is split into three separate Jupyter Notebooks: one to collect the IPL data, inspect it, and clean it; a second to further refine the features and fit the data to a Linear Regression model to train and evaluate our output.
